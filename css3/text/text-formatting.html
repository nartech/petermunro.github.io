    <h1>Fifth Avenue</h1>

    <p>Fifth Avenue is one of the world's famous streets.
What Regent and Bond Streets are to London, the Rue
de la Paix to Paris, the Unter den Linden to Berlin, the
Ringstrasse to Vienna, Fifth Avenue is to New York. It
is the most aesthetic expression of the material side of the
metropolis. A noted English author has characterized it as "architec-
turally the finest street in the world." Its general aspect is one of
great beauty, but its details present surprising contrasts and a few
ugly extremes. Long famous for the beauty of its residences, churches
and hotels, it is now rapidly becoming a great business street of pala-
tial shops. Close inspection shows that it has a manufacturing centre
and also a tenement quarter. Few, even of its residents, know the
Avenue in all its phases. </p>

<p>It is difficult to imagine the contrasts which may be drawn along
the avenue. At one end is venerable Washington Square, the beautiful
Washington Arch, and the dignified homes of some of New York's
oldest families. At the other end, 143rd Street and the Harlem River,
is a quasi-public dump littered with unsightly debris. Within the
seven miles that lie between, may be found some of the most beautiful
homes in the world and unkempt double-decker tenements; building
after building given to the manufacture of wearing apparel, or con-
taining the headquarters or agencies of almost every known industry;
luxurious and expensive hotels, and some of the most beautiful churches
and clubs in this country. Elbowing the churches and the clubs,
and pushing up to the very doors of the stately residences, are some
of the finest shops and art galleries in the world.</p>

<p>This Avenue, the centre of fashion, wealth, society and trade —
where many of the leading business men of America make their home,
and the mart which attracts the most expensive products of America,
Europe, Asia and Africa — changes so rapidly that after an absence of
twenty-five years a former resident would hardly recognize it. To
realize what changes have taken place let us fix in our minds the general
aspect of the Avenue as it now is, sketch its rural aspect a century ago,
and then traverse it leisurely, stopping here and there to catch a
glimpse of its interesting past.</p>



<h2>Present Aspect</h2>

<p>The earliest residential part of Fifth Avenue, below 12th Street,
is to-day much as it was between 1830 and 1840, when the square,
homelike, brownstone and brick houses — the first Fifth Avenue resi-
dences — were built. Trade has left this section untouched, because
the descendants of the old families, some of whom still live in this
locality, have refused to sell; but it has laid an iconoclastic hand upon
the rest of the Avenue below 59th Street. Between 12th and 23rd
Streets the wholesale trade and makers of wearing apparel are en-
trenched; no less than 491 garment factories, employing 51,476
hands, were estimated to be on Fifth Avenue in April 1915.</p>

<p>The Avenue from 23rd to 34th Streets is mainly devoted to retail
specialty shops; while from 34th to 59th Streets, department stores
and exclusive shops now predominate, having either swept away or
flowed around churches, clubs, hotels and residences. Jewelry
shops rivalling those of the famous Rue de la Paix; art galleries which
exhibit wonderful collections of world-famous pictures by old and
modern masters; antique and furniture shops, department stores and
other establishments wherein may be found products of the greatest
ancient and modern artisans make this part of Fifth Avenue one of
the most magnificent streets in the world.</p>

<p>From 60th to 90th Streets is the line of beautiful residences
popularly known as "Millionaires' Row." This mile and a half of
Avenue — probably the most valuable residential section on the globe
— has a total assessed valuation of $71,319,000. Protected here on
one side by Central Park, the Avenue seems to offer effectual resistance
to business.</p>

<p>Onward from Carnegie Hill, at 91st Street, the Avenue rapidly
degenerates into a tenement section with many open lots, fenced with
billboards, and with saloons and refreshment stands on some of the
corners. Beyond Mount Morris Park (120th to 124th Streets) for
several blocks it rises to the dignity of small brownstone or brick dwell-
ings, but quickly drops to the tenement level again. From 127th to
139th Streets it swarms with foreigners and negroes. Beyond, the
Avenue loses its identity in a rutted dirt road bordered by unsightly
open lots, until, at 143rd Street, it comes to a degenerate end in the
slimy waters of the Harlem River.</p>


<h2>Fifth Avenue a Aentury Ago</h2>


<p>We need turn back the hands of time less than a hundred years to
find almost virgin country where this wonderful Avenue now extends.
Prior to 1824 Fifth Avenue had no existence save upon the Commissioners' Map of 1811. During the first quarter of the nineteenth Rural
century the hne which Fifth Avenue follows to-day wandered over Aspect One
"the hills and valleys, dales and fields" of a picturesque countryside, Hundred
where trout, mink, otter and muskrat swam in the brooks and pools; Years ago
brant, black duck and yellow leg splashed in the marshes; the fox,
rabbit, woodcock and partridge found covert in the thickets covering
the rough, rocky hills which characterized the upper part of New
York. A few scattered farms lay about, while the City proper, with a
population of less than 100,000, was still below Canal Street. </p>
